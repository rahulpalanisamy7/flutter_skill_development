Here's a Supabase database schema design for handling notifications efficiently. It covers storing notifications, categorizing them, and associating them with users.

### **Tables and Schema**

#### **1. notifications**
Stores individual notifications.
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Reference to the user
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('customer', 'delivery_personnel')), -- Type of notification
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  icon TEXT, -- Optional field to store icon name
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE -- Read status
);
```

#### **2. user_notifications**
Handles many-to-many relationships if notifications need to be sent to multiple users.
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_notifications (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  notification_id UUID REFERENCES notifications(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

#### **3. notification_types** *(optional, for categorization)*
Defines different types of notifications.
```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_types (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

---

### **How It Works**
- When a notification is created, it's stored in the `notifications` table.
- If a notification is specific to a user, it is linked using the `user_id` column.
- If multiple users receive the same notification, `user_notifications` helps manage the many-to-many relationship.
- The `is_read` field helps track whether a user has seen the notification.
